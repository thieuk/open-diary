            <h1>Why I Created This Space</h1>
            <p>During my last semester of college, I experienced a one-sided love. I was in a group with a guy, NK, for a class project, but I didn't realize my feelings for him until our final day of class on Wednesday, December 4, 2024. The thought of never seeing him again broke my heart, and I poured my emotions into my notes app. Overwhelmed and unsure of how to cope, I considered sharing my feelings online but hesitated, fearing judgment. That's when the idea for this website came to me: a safe space where anyone can share their thoughts and feelings without fear of being judged.</p>
